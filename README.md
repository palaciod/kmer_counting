# kmer_counting
The following is the assignment description I got from class: 
K-mer counting is one of the simplest yet very powerful types of DNA analysis. We can represent any DNA
sequence as a string of four letters: [A,C,G,T]. A k-mer of size k is a substring of k letters. For a sequence
of length l we can enumerate l âˆ’ k + 1 k-mers. For instance, if we consider dna_seq and pick k = 3 we
can enumerate the following 3-mers: [ACT,CTT,TTG,TGA,GAC,ACT,CTT].
